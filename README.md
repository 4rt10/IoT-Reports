This repo is home to IoT security testing reports that I conduct in my spare time. If you notice that it's empty, that's because I'm new to IoT security, and am transitioning from general red-teaming. Your support and advice are appreciated, and I hope you are able to pick up concepts covered in the reports.

All reports are written in LaTeX, and will be available as a PDF in English, Spanish, and Japanese currently. When I am able to practice language-learning more effectively, these reports will also be available in French, German, and Korean.
